# Resume-ATS-Friendly
ATS Friendly LaTeX Resume Template 

## Motivation
I created this resume format using `moderncv`, but I added several new commands and specialized sections. I tried to remove the tables etc.

I had two goals in mind: make it readable by the ATS systems and make it look modern while utilizing as much space as possible. 

Feel free to use and edit for your own use.
